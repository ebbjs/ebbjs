# @ebbjs/core

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 437c80d: The four system types are now `ebb/*` components of one `ebb` model.

  `group`, `groupMember`, `entityGroup` and `relationship` are `ebb/group`, `ebb/grant`,
  `ebb/membership` and `ebb/link`: four **atomic** components, each carrying one object value in one
  Update. A torn edge, membership or grant is unrepresentable.

  ```diff
  -Update { component: "relationship/source_id", method: "patch", data: { value: "todo_1" } }
  -Update { component: "relationship/target_id", method: "patch", data: { value: "todo_2" } }
  -Update { component: "relationship/type",      method: "patch", data: { value: "todo" } }
  -Update { component: "relationship/field",     method: "patch", data: { value: "dependsOn" } }
  +Update { component: "ebb/link", method: "replace",
  +         data: { value: { source_id: "todo_1", target_id: "todo_2",
  +                          type: "todo", field: "dependsOn" } } }
  ```

  `ebb/membership`'s pair, `ebb/link`'s source and `ebb/grant`'s group are fixed at create; moving one
  is a delete plus a create.

  Permission subjects are the component: `group.*` → `ebb/group.*`, `groupMember.*` → `ebb/grant.*`,
  `relationship.update|delete` → `ebb/link.update|delete`. A membership write authorizes as the
  entity's `<model>.create` / `.update`, unchanged.

  A group's `apps` is the list of app ids it is in scope for (`["notes"]`) rather than a map, because
  an atomic value cannot contain a map. Absent is unscoped, `[]` is no app, and a scope edit writes
  the whole `ebb/group` value.

  `@ebbjs/core` exports the component vocabulary — `EBB_COMPONENTS`, `systemValue` — and no longer
  declares the `Group`, `GroupMember` and `Relationship` row schemas; the component values are the
  shapes. `GroupSeed.apps` is a `string[]`.

  The client's replica store moves to v13 and starts empty: its adjacency index keys name components,
  and a stored row is one atomic value.

No changes in this release.

## 1.0.0

### Minor Changes

- ce74122: App scope: a group can declare which apps pull it into their replica.

  `group.apps` is a per-key-merging map from app id to boolean. A group is in
  scope for an app iff its entry is `true`; an absent field (or `null`) means
  unscoped, so every app keeps seeing it. Scope is a **sync/residency filter, not
  an authorization boundary** — the actor's group grants remain the only
  boundary.

  ```ts
  const notes = createClient({ serverUrl, actorId, appId: "notes" });
  const { groups } = await notes.handshake(); // only groups scoped to "notes"
  ```

  - `createClient({ appId })` is a local label; it is never sent as a header or
    token and grants nothing.
  - `client.seed()` scopes every seeded group without an explicit `apps` map to
    the client's app, and `group.create` writes the same scope on the bootstrap
    put. Later edits are single-key patches (`apps.docs = false`), which the
    wire's per-key merge handles per app id. A seed is a put, so re-seeding a
    group replaces its scope map rather than merging it.
  - `handshake()` drops out-of-scope groups and reconciles an active
    subscription: a group whose scope stops naming the app is evicted and the
    live stream reopens without it. Newly in-scope groups are not auto-added to
    an existing subscription.
  - `@ebbjs/schema`'s `groupSystemEntity` gains the field, so `GroupFields`
    includes `apps` on every client group read. `@ebbjs/core`'s `GroupSeed`
    gains an optional `apps` map.

  Live scope changes (`groups_changed`) are tracked separately; today a scope
  edit takes effect on the app's next handshake.

- 6e2df83: Absence, defaults, and null filters (breaking summary).

  Absence is first-class: a field declares a read-time default with
  `.default(v)`, and projection resolves `stored ?? default`. A defaulted field
  reads as `T`; a field without one reads as `T | undefined`. A tombstone is
  absence with an HLC, not a stored null, so no field schema admits `Null` and
  `.nullable()` is gone.

  `create()` may omit exactly the defaulted fields. A draft or committed update
  clears a field with `unset` — `update(todo, { dueDate: unset })`, or one map key
  with `{ tags: { a: unset } }` — which compiles to the existing tombstone
  envelope; a literal `null` in a payload is rejected with a message naming
  `unset`.

  A query filter is a disjunction of groups (`where` ANDs within a group, `or`
  starts a new one) and `null` means "no live value". Defaults never widen a
  filter: a bare equality excludes rows nobody set, and `client.queryEntities`
  emits a non-fatal warning when a filter compares a defaulted field without a
  `{ field: null }` term in any group.

  Wire-compatible on storage: tombstones, HLCs, the merge rule, and
  `fixtures/merge_vectors.json` are unchanged. Filters gain the group shape on the
  wire; `{ field: null }` now emits `IS NULL`.

- 6e2df83: Clear a field with `unset`, not `null`.

  ```ts
  update(todo, { dueDate: unset });
  update(todo, { tags: { a: unset } }); // one map key
  ```

  `unset` is a frozen singleton recognised by `isUnset`, exported from
  `@ebbjs/core` and re-exported from `@ebbjs/write` and `@ebbjs/client`. The
  draft and committed update payload types accept it per field (and per map key);
  `wrapFields` compiles it to the existing tombstone envelope
  (`{ value: null, update_id, hlc }`), so the merge rule, the merge vectors, and
  the Elixir side are unchanged. `validatePayload` skips the marker — it is not a
  value — and rejects a literal `null` in a payload with a message naming
  `unset`. A literal `null` still passes through `wrapFields`, because tombstones
  arrive from other producers; rejecting it belongs at validation, where the
  intent is knowable. A `null` filter value keeps meaning "no live value".

## 0.3.0

No changes in this release.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- a46e201: `receiveRemoteHLC` now refuses only a remote HLC more than 120s ahead of the wall clock, mirroring the server's `ActionValidator`, and validates the remote value before mutating the clock so a refused merge is a no-op. Any past HLC is accepted because it only loses the merge. This narrows the public `MAX_FUTURE_DRIFT_MS` to a bound on the remote value rather than the merged local clock, and removes `MAX_PAST_DRIFT_MS` from `@ebbjs/core`'s exports.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- d19bff2: Republish through npm trusted publishing to validate the OIDC release path.
  No functional change. `0.1.0` was bootstrapped with a granular token and is the
  only version of these packages published without provenance.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 2004274: First public release. All `@ebbjs/*` packages share one version and ship together; `@ebbjs/server` and `@ebbjs/www` stay private.
