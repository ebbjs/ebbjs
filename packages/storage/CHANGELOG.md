### Major Changes

- b113df5: Collaborative text now stores immutable run cells and additive cut cells.

  A text body is a `content` map of cells — a run is a fixed string anchored at
  `(parentRunId, offset)`, and a delete is a cut `[from, to)` over the run it
  belongs to. Runs are never split, rewritten, or extended: an insert at the end
  of a run is a new run anchored at that run's length, and an insert mid-run is a
  new run anchored at the offset, so editing one run cannot invalidate another
  replica's writes. Cuts union per run, so concurrent deletes and delete-vs-insert
  commute.

  This changes what a persisted text body means:
  - The internal encoding of a text body changed. The `content` map is
    **append-only** — a cell id, once written, is never rewritten — and the body
    now carries a `version` leaf declaring the cell format. Every write stamps
    it; a read of an unknown version fails with `DocumentVersionError`. A body
    without the leaf (an empty seeded document) is read as the current version.
  - `deleted` and tombstone cell encodings are gone. Deletes are cut cells, and
    projection hides the covered characters of the owning run, leaving text
    inserted around them visible.
  - Conflict slots collapse for text. Concurrent same-run edits are no longer
    conflicts, because runs and cuts merge without a losing action: the merged
    `content` map is the whole state. Text surfaces no conflict slots.
  - An old IndexedDB database resets at open. `@ebbjs/storage` bumps
    `EBB_SCHEMA_VERSION` to 9; a database below 9 is discarded and rebuilt empty
    rather than migrated, so a tab carrying pre-release text rows does not
    half-read the new cell format. Server-side actions are untouched — this is a
    local-store reset.

  `@ebbjs/client` and `@ebbjs/codemirror` follow the same cell format, and both
  re-export the constants a caller needs (`DOC_CONTENT_FIELD`, `DOC_VERSION_FIELD`,
  `CURRENT_TEXT_VERSION`, the cell schemas).

### Minor Changes

- 48e9b64: Read entity history from the replica's Action log.

  `client.history({ entityId, limit?, beforeGsn? })` returns one `HistoryEvent` per Action that touched the entity, newest first, with the actor, HLC, GSN, the entity's Update methods, and the field-level `changes` in the same `EntityDiff` vocabulary the conflict view uses. `client.replay({ entityId, at: { actionId } })` folds the log up to a past Action and returns the row as it stood then, including the retained fields of a tombstone.

  The read is bounded by the local log: local writes appear only after their echo, `limit` slices a full `getForEntity` read, and compaction (#123) will shorten the window. Those cases — unknown entity, tombstoned entity, absent history, late joiner — are documented in the new "Entity history" page.

  Internally the conflict diff (`EntityDiff`, `diffEntity`) moved to `@ebbjs/write` and the per-entity fold (`foldEntityAction`) moved into `@ebbjs/storage`'s materialization helpers, so history, the conflict view, and both entity stores share one projection and one fold. `EntityDiff` remains exported from `@ebbjs/client`.

- e543a97: One generic conflict: scope is declared, policy is application code.

  Ebb holds and reports; the application copies a backup, resolves, does
  nothing, or writes again. Ebb is pre-1.0, so the breaking surface ships as a
  minor rather than a major, following the #692 precedent.

  Removed:
  - `client.conflicts.resolve(conflictId, "retry" | "discard")`,
    `client.conflicts.resolveEntries(entryIds, ...)`, and the
    `ConflictResolution` type.
  - `Conflict.remoteWins()`. It was an entity-level aggregate of a position-level
    question. Read `entry.slots[i].remoteWins()` for field scope; an
    entity-scope entry has no slots.
  - The `retry` re-stamp path (`restampField`, `restampUpdate`, `restampAction`,
    and the `stampAction` / `hlc` / `generateUpdateId` collaborators). Re-stamping
    every leaf recursed into map entries and rewrote their `update_id` and HLC —
    the only code path that could silently fabricate ordering on an append-only
    log. "Make my value win" is a normal write through `defineAction` with a
    fresh clock.
  - `Outbox.retryConflicted(originalId, action)`. It is replaced by
    `releaseConflict(actionId)`, which returns the row to `pending` with its
    Action untouched.

  New verbs:
  - `client.conflicts.sendLocalActions(conflictId)` clears the hold and submits
    the held Actions verbatim — same action id, Update ids, and field HLCs.
  - `client.conflicts.clearLocalActions(conflictId)` drops the held Actions and
    the local writes the hold was keeping off the wire, converging those
    subjects on the server's view.

  Subject hold:
  - Every subject named by an open conflict is held. A later local write to it is
    durable and applied optimistically, but `pending()` and the flush exclude it
    until the conflict resolves.
  - The hold is derived from the durable `conflicted` rows, so a reload preserves
    it with no second store.
  - The hold applies to `pending` writes only; an `acknowledged` write is already
    on the server and is never re-held. Detection now considers `pending` writes
    only for the same reason.
  - `Outbox.heldPending(subjects)` snapshots the writes a hold excludes and
    `Outbox.dropHeld(actionIds)` removes exactly those; a write made after the
    hold lifts is never dropped.

  Report additions: `Conflict.scope` and `Conflict.remoteActions` (actor id,
  action id, GSN of the concurrent missed Actions). The per-subject `before` /
  `after` rows and their `EntityDiff` already existed. `ConflictEntry.slots` is
  now absent for an entity-scope entry, and `ConflictEntry` carries its own
  `scope` and `remoteActions`. `OutboxConflict` gains required `scope` and
  `remoteActions` fields, persisted under IndexedDB schema version 10 (additive:
  a pre-v10 row reads as field scope with no recorded remote context).
  `ConflictRemoteAction` is exported from `@ebbjs/storage/types` and
  `@ebbjs/client`; `ConflictScope` remains the single declaration exported from
  `@ebbjs/schema`. The IndexedDB outbox store normalizes a pre-v10 payload on
  read, so a row written before the bump cannot make the conflict view
  unreachable.

  `clearLocalActions` drops the pending writes to the conflict's subjects, so the
  subjects really converge. An Action writing several subjects is held or
  dropped whole; an Action cannot be sent in part. In a partial pass, only the
  subjects the resolved entries released are converged; a subject a failed entry still names stays held and keeps its
  writes. A durable-store fault in the final drop or flush rejects rather than
  returning a partial result.

### Minor Changes

- a46e201: `receiveRemoteHLC` now refuses only a remote HLC more than 120s ahead of the wall clock, mirroring the server's `ActionValidator`, and validates the remote value before mutating the clock so a refused merge is a no-op. Any past HLC is accepted because it only loses the merge. This narrows the public `MAX_FUTURE_DRIFT_MS` to a bound on the remote value rather than the merged local clock, and removes `MAX_PAST_DRIFT_MS` from `@ebbjs/core`'s exports.
