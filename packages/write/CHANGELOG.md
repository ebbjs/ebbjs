# @ebbjs/write

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- cbac1a0: Add `e.object(fields)` — a nested object as one atomic component value.

  `e.object` is a closed object (`additionalProperties: false`) behind the same
  `.default()` chain as every other builder, and a write carries it as one LWW
  leaf (`{ value: {...} }`), so two concurrent whole-object writes converge on
  one authored value rather than a synthesized one. Nested properties are
  declared exactly as authored (`Type.Optional(...)` is how one is optional), and
  a map nested inside an object is refused at declaration because it would lose
  its per-key merge.

  Definition and validation now agree on nested shapes: `admitsNull` recurses
  into object properties and array items, and a nested `unset` (inside an object
  or an array item) is refused once, with its path and a pointer at `e.map`,
  instead of being stripped into a shape error. `wrapFields` throws rather than
  sending the sentinel or an empty object.

  A query compares an object or array field value structurally, so
  `where("anchor", { x: 1, y: 2 })` matches the stored value regardless of key
  order. Ordering is scalar-only: `orderBy` refuses an object or array field at
  the type level and at runtime instead of tying every row on `[object Object]`.

### Major Changes

- b8fe081: `e.collaborativeText()` and the derived-body mechanism are deleted.

  A text body is no longer a hidden part of its parent. A document is an entity
  the app declares, and a relationship it declares:

  ```ts
  const note = defineEntity("note", { title: e.string() });
  const textDocument = defineEntity(
    "text_document",
    { content: e.map(TextCellSchema), version: e.number() },
    { materialization: "on-demand" },
  );
  const schema = defineSchema({
    entities: { note, text_document: textDocument },
    relationships: {
      body: defineRelationship({
        source: note,
        target: textDocument,
        as: "body",
        sourceCardinality: "one",
      }),
    },
  });
  ```

  Creating a note with its document is `create` + `create` + `link` inside one
  `defineAction`, so both rows and their link still land in one Action. No body
  input, no generated entity, and no hidden part is involved.

  What else changes:
  - `defineSchema` produces exactly the entities and relationships it is given.
    Nothing is generated, so no schema hash, permission string, entity name, id,
    or row accessor is minted behind the app's back.
  - A forward-one accessor over a document relationship resolves the target
    entity, like any other link. Read an on-demand document through its own
    namespace — `client.text_document.get(id)` — which also pins it;
    `client.textDocument(id, type)` and `client.openDerivedTextDocument(id, type)`
    still return the editing handle, but they neither read nor pin the row, so
    hydrate it from the row's `content` / `version`. Both openers go away in #779.
  - `defineSchema` rejects an entity-map key that differs from the definition's
    own `name` with `EntityKeyMismatchError`. A preset keyed under another name
    would otherwise have addressed another entity type — and another permission
    string.
  - Deleted: `e.collaborativeText`, `EntityDef.derived`, `DerivedKeys`,
    `DerivedAccessors`, `DerivedFieldDef`, `WireFields`, `expandDerivedFields`,
    `derivedBodyIds`, `generatedDocEntityName`, `isCollaborativeText`,
    `RelationshipKind` and the relationship `kind`, the `generatedParts`
    capability, and the reserved `text_document__` entity prefix. Every public
    `Derived*` / `CollaborativeText*` / `Generated*` type and error class goes with
    them, as do `DERIVED_DOC_ENTITY_PREFIX`, `hasDerivedDocPrefix`,
    `TextDocumentFields`, `buildTextDocumentEntity`, `ReadCapability.openTextDocument`,
    and `ChangeGroupsInput.generated`.
  - Moving a note between groups does **not** move its document, and duplicating a
    note does not duplicate its document. Both gaps are deliberate: relationships
    will own their group membership (#790) and subgraph copy lands in #784, so no
    interim cascade ships here.

### Minor Changes

- ce74122: App scope: a group can declare which apps pull it into their replica.

  `group.apps` is a per-key-merging map from app id to boolean. A group is in
  scope for an app iff its entry is `true`; an absent field (or `null`) means
  unscoped, so every app keeps seeing it. Scope is a **sync/residency filter, not
  an authorization boundary** — the actor's group grants remain the only
  boundary.

  ```ts
  const notes = createClient({ serverUrl, actorId, appId: "notes" });
  const { groups } = await notes.handshake(); // only groups scoped to "notes"
  ```

  - `createClient({ appId })` is a local label; it is never sent as a header or
    token and grants nothing.
  - `client.seed()` scopes every seeded group without an explicit `apps` map to
    the client's app, and `group.create` writes the same scope on the bootstrap
    put. Later edits are single-key patches (`apps.docs = false`), which the
    wire's per-key merge handles per app id. A seed is a put, so re-seeding a
    group replaces its scope map rather than merging it.
  - `handshake()` drops out-of-scope groups and reconciles an active
    subscription: a group whose scope stops naming the app is evicted and the
    live stream reopens without it. Newly in-scope groups are not auto-added to
    an existing subscription.
  - `@ebbjs/schema`'s `groupSystemEntity` gains the field, so `GroupFields`
    includes `apps` on every client group read. `@ebbjs/core`'s `GroupSeed`
    gains an optional `apps` map.

  Live scope changes (`groups_changed`) are tracked separately; today a scope
  edit takes effect on the app's next handshake.

- 6e2df83: Absence, defaults, and null filters (breaking summary).

  Absence is first-class: a field declares a read-time default with
  `.default(v)`, and projection resolves `stored ?? default`. A defaulted field
  reads as `T`; a field without one reads as `T | undefined`. A tombstone is
  absence with an HLC, not a stored null, so no field schema admits `Null` and
  `.nullable()` is gone.

  `create()` may omit exactly the defaulted fields. A draft or committed update
  clears a field with `unset` — `update(todo, { dueDate: unset })`, or one map key
  with `{ tags: { a: unset } }` — which compiles to the existing tombstone
  envelope; a literal `null` in a payload is rejected with a message naming
  `unset`.

  A query filter is a disjunction of groups (`where` ANDs within a group, `or`
  starts a new one) and `null` means "no live value". Defaults never widen a
  filter: a bare equality excludes rows nobody set, and `client.queryEntities`
  emits a non-fatal warning when a filter compares a defaulted field without a
  `{ field: null }` term in any group.

  Wire-compatible on storage: tombstones, HLCs, the merge rule, and
  `fixtures/merge_vectors.json` are unchanged. Filters gain the group shape on the
  wire; `{ field: null }` now emits `IS NULL`.

- 6e2df83: Read types state absence: a field with a declared default reads as `T`, a field
  without one reads as `T | undefined`. `EntityDef` gains `createShape`, the
  inverse relation (a defaulted field may be omitted on create, a field without
  one is required), so `ShapeFields` is no longer the mirror of the validation
  wrap. `where()` / `or()` accept `null` as the "no live value" predicate.
  Duplicate validation and system-entity creates accept absence per field rather
  than requiring a complete row.
- 6e2df83: Clear a field with `unset`, not `null`.

  ```ts
  update(todo, { dueDate: unset });
  update(todo, { tags: { a: unset } }); // one map key
  ```

  `unset` is a frozen singleton recognised by `isUnset`, exported from
  `@ebbjs/core` and re-exported from `@ebbjs/write` and `@ebbjs/client`. The
  draft and committed update payload types accept it per field (and per map key);
  `wrapFields` compiles it to the existing tombstone envelope
  (`{ value: null, update_id, hlc }`), so the merge rule, the merge vectors, and
  the Elixir side are unchanged. `validatePayload` skips the marker — it is not a
  value — and rejects a literal `null` in a payload with a message naming
  `unset`. A literal `null` still passes through `wrapFields`, because tombstones
  arrive from other producers; rejecting it belongs at validation, where the
  intent is knowable. A `null` filter value keeps meaning "no live value".

- 48e9b64: Read entity history from the replica's Action log.

  `client.history({ entityId, limit?, beforeGsn? })` returns one `HistoryEvent` per Action that touched the entity, newest first, with the actor, HLC, GSN, the entity's Update methods, and the field-level `changes` in the same `EntityDiff` vocabulary the conflict view uses. `client.replay({ entityId, at: { actionId } })` folds the log up to a past Action and returns the row as it stood then, including the retained fields of a tombstone.

  The read is bounded by the local log: local writes appear only after their echo, `limit` slices a full `getForEntity` read, and compaction (#123) will shorten the window. Those cases — unknown entity, tombstoned entity, absent history, late joiner — are documented in the new "Entity history" page.

  Internally the conflict diff (`EntityDiff`, `diffEntity`) moved to `@ebbjs/write` and the per-entity fold (`foldEntityAction`) moved into `@ebbjs/storage`'s materialization helpers, so history, the conflict view, and both entity stores share one projection and one fold. `EntityDiff` remains exported from `@ebbjs/client`.

### Patch Changes

- 3df4a29: Extract the shared write planner into `@ebbjs/schema` and `@ebbjs/write`.

  `@ebbjs/schema` now owns the entity, relationship, and schema definitions, the
  registry, validation, system entities, reserved names, and the
  collaborative-text field type. `@ebbjs/write` owns the operation vocabulary and
  the pure wire builders: create/update/delete/duplicate, membership scope and the
  membership refusals, the committer, relationship and `entityGroup` Updates,
  generated-part types, pointer normalization, and field projection.

  `@ebbjs/client` re-exports everything it exported before, so its public API is
  unchanged; the dependency direction is now `core → schema → write → client`.
  Nothing on the wire or in storage changes: this is a move, and the existing
  client suite is the regression gate. The functions runtime can build Updates
  from `@ebbjs/write` without depending on the client.

- ad79662: Declare components as the unit of a model's identity.

  `@ebbjs/schema` now exports `defineComponent`, `ComponentDef`, `ModelDef`, and
  `ModelRegistry`. `defineModel` accepts named components and bare field builders
  in one map; a builder normalises to an anonymous component named
  `<model>/<field>`, so existing field declarations keep their meaning.
  `ModelDef.components` records the declarations and `ModelDef.shape` is derived
  from them. Components declare their policy, including `loading: "eager" | "lazy"`. `defineSchema` takes `models` instead of `entities`, and rejects a
  component whose name does not belong to its model.

  This is a shape change only: the wire, storage, and merge rules are unchanged.
  The rename is mechanical — `defineEntity` → `defineModel`, `EntityDef` →
  `ModelDef`, `EntityRegistry` → `ModelRegistry` — and has no compatibility alias.
