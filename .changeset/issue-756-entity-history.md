Read entity history from the replica's Action log.

`client.history({ entityId, limit?, beforeGsn? })` returns one `HistoryEvent` per Action that touched the entity, newest first, with the actor, HLC, GSN, the entity's Update methods, and the field-level `changes` in the same `EntityDiff` vocabulary the conflict view uses. `client.replay({ entityId, at: { actionId } })` folds the log up to a past Action and returns the row as it stood then, including the retained fields of a tombstone.

The read is bounded by the local log: local writes appear only after their echo, `limit` slices a full `getForEntity` read, and compaction (#123) will shorten the window. Those cases — unknown entity, tombstoned entity, absent history, late joiner — are documented in the new "Entity history" page.

Internally the conflict diff (`EntityDiff`, `diffEntity`) moved to `@ebbjs/write` and the per-entity fold (`foldEntityAction`) moved into `@ebbjs/storage`'s materialization helpers, so history, the conflict view, and both entity stores share one projection and one fold. `EntityDiff` remains exported from `@ebbjs/client`.
